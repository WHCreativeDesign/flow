# flow

**a personal environment** · by [cloak](https://usecloak.org) · `flow.usecloak.org`

Not an operating system. Not an app. One live instance per user, accessible from any device on the network, rendering natively per device class rather than mirroring a screen.

## The model

A ship's computer: one authoritative instance; every screen is a terminal into it. Devices don't sync with each other — they all read and write one source of truth, so no cross-device conflict resolution exists or is needed.

## Three states, no others

There is no desktop, no windows, no z-index stacking. Any surface running flow is in exactly one of:

| state | behavior |
|---|---|
| **idle** | Ambient drift, clock visible. Wakes on any touch or motion. |
| **home** | A field of orbs — a surface of held apps, not an icon grid. |
| **app** | Edge to edge, zero chrome. One universal edge-swipe-up returns home. |

The signature gesture is **press → release → bloom**: an orb compresses under the finger (~0.83, fast ease-in), then expands from its exact origin point to fill the screen. Never slide, never cut, never cross-fade.

## Motion law

1. No linear easing anywhere.
2. Grow from the touch (`transform-origin` set at press time).
3. Everything has weight — press compresses, release overshoots, then settles.
4. Idle still breathes; nothing in flow is ever fully still.

Easings live in [`src/styles/tokens.css`](src/styles/tokens.css) and nowhere else.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # static SPA bundle → dist/
npm run check    # svelte-check / typescript
```

## Architecture

- **Frontend** — Svelte 5 + Vite, fully static SPA. Hosted on GitHub Pages ([`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)); `index.html` is copied to `404.html` at build time as the SPA fallback, and `public/CNAME` pins `flow.usecloak.org`.
- **Sync** — the UI talks only to the [`InstanceClient`](src/lib/sync/InstanceClient.ts) interface, never to a backend SDK directly. `MemoryInstanceClient` (per-tab state) is the current implementation; the v1 hosted backend arrives next pass as a second implementation, and a phase-two `LocalInstanceClient` moves authority to a Raspberry Pi — each a swap behind the interface, never a rewrite.

## Design

Light mode only. Blue hybrid of Liquid Glass and Frutiger Aero — depth from stacked atmosphere layers (bokeh at three blur depths, aurora, caustics, lens bloom, grain), never from a flat gradient. Depth comes from saturation, not darkness.

- Palette, type scale, and motion tokens: [`src/styles/tokens.css`](src/styles/tokens.css)
- Two materials, one physics: frosted glass frames, liquid is touched. Anything touchable is liquid; anything framing it is glass.
- Type: **Quicksand** (wordmark/headings), **Hanken Grotesk** (everything read at length).
- Branding is lowercase everywhere: `flow`, never `Flow`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected deliberately — drift stops, state changes become near-instant fades.

Visual source of truth: the brand prototype `flow-brand-v2.html` (kept outside this repo); the production shell reimplements its tested material values and easings.

## Build order (handoff §7)

- [x] 1. Repo + deploy pipeline (Pages, CNAME, SPA fallback)
- [x] 2. Design system (tokens, orb, glass/liquid materials, atmosphere)
- [x] 3. Three-state shell with the universal swipe layer
- [x] 4. Bloom transition (press → compress → expand-from-origin)
- [ ] 5. Backend setup — next pass (schema, RLS on every table, auth; verify a second browser cannot read the first user's rows)
- [ ] 6. Instance + sync wiring in-app (auth UI, backend `InstanceClient` implementation, `connect()` on boot)
- [ ] 7. Multi-device: Realtime shared state, adaptive rendering per device class
- [ ] 8. Pi migration: `LocalInstanceClient`, mDNS `flow.local`, tunnel for off-network
- [ ] 9. Offline transports: Bluetooth → audio → QR burst
- [ ] 10. Real apps
